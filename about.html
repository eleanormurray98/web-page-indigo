<h1>VegFoodies: Vegan Food in London</h1>

<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>As part of the curriculum for the CodeFirst:Girls Beginners Coding Course, this project was created by two students from the University of Westminster. </p>

<h3>Eleanor</h3>
<p>A second year International Relations and Development student.</p>

<h3>Zeenath</h3>
<p>A final year Business Management (Human Resource Management) student.</p>

<p>In an attempt to eat more sustainably we have both explored London in search for the best vegan food. Finding a lack of dedicated websites online, we hoped to fill this gap.</p>

<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
<p>Thank you to CodeFirst:Girls, for providing us with the skills to code this website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery and JavaScript and proving that coding isnâ€™t just for men! </p>
